# Testing knowledge of functions and objects

## ðŸ¤”What types of functions are used here ?

-Regular functions ,that take parameters and return values based on their logic ```function add(b, c) {
  return (b + c)  }```.

-Method Functions, that are assigned as properties of objects ```
function internal( ) {code}

const example1 = {
  ...
  calculate: internal, // `calculate` is a method function
};```
