## 1.1. Features:🌐
 This code was created after learning about objects and the different types of functions.
 It was a debugging exercise to test the knowledge acquired about objects and functions combined.

## 1.2. What types of functions are used here 🤔?

▶Regular functions ,that take parameters and return values based on their logic ```function add(b, c) {
  return (b + c)  }```.

▶Method Functions, that are assigned as properties of objects 
```
 function internal( ) {code}

 const example1 = {
  ...
  calculate: internal, // `calculate` is a method function
}
```
## 1.3. And how does this relate to your object 🤔?
 These functions are being called in the object
