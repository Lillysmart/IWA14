    <p> The following code snippet should have three functions that are declared outside an object. After creation, these functions are assigned to different objects, after which the calculate method is run on each of the objects.

 

        At the moment the code below gives the following error:
        
         
        
        Missing initializer in const declaration
        
        
        The code should log these two values to the console:
        
        48
        12
         
        
        Please fix the code above the // Not allowed to change below this comment, while still keeping it as three different functions.
        
         
        
        Summary:
        
        Edit only the code above the comment
        Keep the three functions: add, multiply, internal
        Log the values 48 and 12 to the console</p>
